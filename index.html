            <<h2>My AME experience</h2>
            <div class="article-info">Posted on <time datetime="0000-mm-dd">May 2, 2017</time> by <a href="About Me.html" rel="author">The Author</a></div>
            <p>This is prolly the part where I'm supposed to reminisce about the past and think about what a LIFE-CHANGING class those 3 years of AME was...but no. I didn't really feel particularly satisfied or sad then or now. I had kinda mixed feelings like being tired of or frustrated with a project. And that was it.</p>
            <p>To be completely honest, I prefered the very first year of AME when we were doing coding or photoshop and animation. They were the kinds of things where you could decide all the details on your own and do things at your own pace. Filming was a whole new other thing and might I say, a complete pain in the ass. I had to worry about what we were going to film, when we were going to film, and how we were going to film it as well as getting actors. Editing was fine tho. Just drag and drop in the correct order. In fact, it was kind of relaxing to do, especially when you could choose your own music.</p>
            <p>I won't lower myself to ever say that this class has motivated me or change my life. I know my goals and have kept them from the very beginning. I never needed anyone to tell me what I should do with my life and I'm not so easily swayed that something like this could make me switch goals. I have decided on programmming from the very beginning and I will keep going for it.</p>
